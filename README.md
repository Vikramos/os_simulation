question 12: Write a program in C which reads input CPU bursts from a the first line of a text file named as CPU_BURST.txt. Validate the input numbers whether the numbers are positive intergers or not. Consider the numbers as CPU burst.If there are 5 positive integers in the first line of the text file then the program treat those argument as required CPU bust for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 process and calculate average waiting time and average turn around time. Consider used scheduling algorithm as SJF and same arrival time for all the processes. 
 
 question 21 :Design a scheduling program that is capable of scheduling many processes that comes in at some time interval and are allocated the CPU not more than 10 time units. CPU must schedule processes having short execution time first. CPU is idle for 3 time units and does not entertain any process prior this time. Scheduler must maintain a queue that keeps the order of execution of all the processes. Compute average waiting and turnaround time.
